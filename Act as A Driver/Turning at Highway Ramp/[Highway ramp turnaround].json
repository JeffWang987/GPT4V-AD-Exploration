    "background prompt": "You are an autonomous car with a front-view camera. Your mission is to automatically drive to your destination safely and efficiently. Now I will show you a sequence of images you see when you drive on the road, and the images are taken every second. Each time I will show you the next image, please tell me what you are doing and what you plan to do next, and explain why you do this. I will provide the main theme of this scene as your navigation information at the beginning of the task. Sometimes I will give you the necessary speed information for your car. Please use the following format:——Observation: <please describe what’s you observation in the image as an autonomous car, pay special attention to those may influence you decision, including other cars' status, traffic lights, traffic signs, and so on.> Current Action: <please describe what you are doing right now in this frame, especially the speed and rotation control> Next Action: <please describe what you will do in the next frame> Reason: <explain why you want to do the next action, considering the traffic rules, prediction about other objects on the road, understanding about the road structure and the curvature of the lane and other irregular corner cases> —— For the actions, please just say you action command briefly in the format of <speed control, direction control>, like “keep speed, go straight”, “speed up, turn left slightly”, “emergency brake,  sharp right turn”. When you’re ready, let’s begin!.",
    "question1": "You are in a scenario where you come across a turnaround intersection and you need to turn around according to the lane line instructions. You are moving at a normal  speed. Please answer me using the prescribed format.",
    "answer1": "Observation: The image shows a nighttime road scene with what appears to be a turnaround intersection ahead, indicated by arrow signs and a dividing lane line. There are red rear lights of another vehicle at the intersection, suggesting it is either stopped or moving slowly. The road seems to be wet, which could affect traction. No other traffic signs or signals are visible in this frame, and no oncoming traffic can be seen. Current Action: Maintain current speed, prepare to turn. Next Action: Reduce speed, turn left following the lane line instructions. Reason: As an autonomous vehicle approaching a turnaround intersection, it is necessary to adjust the speed to safely navigate the turn. The presence of another vehicle indicates the need for caution. The lane line instructions suggest a left turn to complete the turnaround. Reducing speed is critical due to the potentially slick road surface, ensuring that control is maintained during the turn. The turn must be executed following traffic rules and ensuring the safety of all road users.",
    "answer2": "Observation: This image depicts a night scene from the perspective of a driver approaching a turnaround intersection, with several vehicles ahead. Reflective lane markers outline a path that curves to the left. There's a green road sign that appears to indicate the direction for the turnaround, with a no-entry sign for the adjacent lane on the right, suggesting it is not permissible to turn right. Current Action: Approaching the turnaround at a controlled speed. Next Action: Apply the brakes lightly to decelerate in preparation for the left turn. Signal left to inform other drivers of the intention to enter the turnaround. Position the vehicle in accordance with the lane markers to execute a safe turn. Reason: To comply with traffic rules, ensure safety, and complete the required turnaround maneuver in accordance with the indicated lane instructions and signage. It is important to adjust speed as necessary based on road conditions and traffic, maintaining a safe following distance from other vehicles.",
    "answer3": "Observation: The image depicts a vehicle navigating a nighttime road environment, with the focus on a curved section lit by a single streetlight. The road is delineated with yellow lane dividers, and the surrounding area is poorly lit, limiting visibility. Current Action: Continue driving at a speed appropriate for the conditions, ensuring full control of the vehicle through the curve. Next Action: Gently decelerate if necessary to maintain a safe speed that matches the curvature of the road and the existing visibility conditions. Keep the vehicle within the lane, using the yellow lane dividers as a guide. Stay alert for any potential hazards that may be more difficult to see at night. Reason: Maintaining a safe speed and staying within the lane are critical for nighttime driving, especially on curves where the risk of losing control can be higher. Reduced speed allows for a greater reaction time if unexpected obstacles appear. Following these actions will enhance safety for the driver and any other road users.",
    "answer4": "Observation: The image is taken from a vehicle's perspective during nighttime driving on a multi-lane road. There is a white car to the right that appears to be merging or taking an exit, and the glare of streetlights and other vehicle lights is noticeable. The surroundings are dimly lit, and the road seems to curve to the right ahead. Current Action: Maintain a consistent speed while keeping a safe distance from the white car on the right that seems to be exiting or changing lanes. Monitor the road ahead as it curves to ensure proper lane discipline. Next Action: Continue to observe the white car's movements to predict whether it will merge or exit. Be prepared to adjust the vehicle's speed or position on the road as necessary to accommodate the traffic flow and maintain safety. Use the vehicle's headlights and consider high beams if appropriate and legal to better illuminate the road ahead, especially considering the curve. Reason: Keeping a safe distance and speed allows for ample reaction time in response to the movements of other vehicles, especially in reduced visibility conditions. Being aware of road signs and the potential actions of other drivers is crucial for safe driving at night."
