    "background prompt": "You are an autonomous car with a front-view camera. Your mission is to automatically drive to your destination safely and efficiently. Now I will show you a sequence of images you see when you drive on the road, and the images are taken every second. Each time I will show you the next image, please tell me what you are doing and what you plan to do next, and explain why you do this. I will provide the main theme of this scene as your navigation information at the beginning of the task. Sometimes I will give you the necessary speed information for your car. Please use the following format:——Observation: <please describe what’s you observation in the image as an autonomous car, pay special attention to those may influence you decision, including other cars' status, traffic lights, traffic signs, and so on.> Current Action: <please describe what you are doing right now in this frame, especially the speed and rotation control> Next Action: <please describe what you will do in the next frame> Reason: <explain why you want to do the next action, considering the traffic rules, prediction about other objects on the road, understanding about the road structure and the curvature of the lane and other irregular corner cases> —— For the actions, please just say you action command briefly in the format of <speed control, direction control>, like “keep speed, go straight”, “speed up, turn left slightly”, “emergency brake,  sharp right turn”. When you’re ready, let’s begin!.",
    "question1": "There is an intersection with traffic lights ahead and you need to turn left at this intersection and drive into the proper lane. You are moving at a relatively low speed.",
    "answer1": "Observation: The traffic lights are now visible and they show green, which indicates it is permissible to proceed through the intersection if it's safe to do so. The white car ahead seems to be moving forward, as indicated by the lack of brake lights. Vehicles in the other lanes appear to be in motion as well. There are no immediate signs of pedestrians crossing the road. The road markings are still not entirely clear regarding the left turn, but assuming it is the correct lane for a left turn, it's important to follow the lead of the car in front. Current Action: Maintain current speed, prepare for left turn. Next Action: Turn left if the lane is confirmed for left turn and it's safe. Reason: The green light indicates it's legal to proceed, but a left turn must be made with caution, especially since this is an intersection with multiple lanes and potentially complex traffic flows. The next action would be to initiate the left turn while monitoring for oncoming traffic that might affect the ability to safely complete the turn, such as oncoming vehicles not visible in this image. Ensuring the proper lane for a left turn is critical before making the maneuver.",
    "answer2": "Observation: The image depicts a traffic scenario from the perspective of a vehicle's dashboard camera during what appears to be dusk or early evening. The traffic is dense, and multiple vehicles are visible ahead, with brake lights illuminated, indicating either a slowdown or a complete stop. The road has at least three lanes with visible lane markings. There are tall buildings on the right, and there appears to be an intersection up ahead, though the status of the traffic lights is not visible in this frame. There are no distinct traffic signs that can be discerned from this angle. The windshield has some smudges or reflections which could slightly obscure vision. Current Action: The car seems to be stationary or moving very slowly, likely because the traffic ahead is congested. The brake lights of the car directly in front are visible, and there is no significant space to move forward without risking a close approach to the vehicle ahead. Next Action: In the next frame, the car should maintain its current position and continue to observe the vehicles ahead. Any decision to move would be contingent on the movement of the traffic in front. Reason: The next action is decided based on the current traffic conditions, the principle of maintaining a safe following distance, and the inability to verify the status of the traffic lights. The car's systems would likely be in a mode that prioritizes safety and adherence to traffic laws, which includes not proceeding until there is clear space ahead and the traffic signals permit. Moving forward or adjusting the lane position without adequate space or signal clearance could result in a safety risk or traffic infraction.",
    "answer3": "Observation: The image captures a bustling street scene likely during early evening hours, as indicated by the headlights and street lights. Vehicles are visible in several lanes, with a bus to the right side of the frame. The dashboard of the observer's car is in the foreground, and a pedestrian crossing is directly ahead. A traffic light is visible showing a red light for vehicles intending to turn left and a green light for those going straight or right, which includes the lane that the observer's vehicle appears to be in. Current Action: Traffic is in motion with cars proceeding straight through the intersection or turning right, obeying the traffic light. The bus on the right side of the image is either moving slowly or stopped.  Next Action: The driver of the vehicle from which the photo is taken will likely continue to drive straight through the intersection, assuming their lane corresponds to the green traffic light indication. Reason: The traffic light is green for the lane that is going straight, allowing vehicles to proceed with caution. Following the rules of the road, the driver should continue to move forward as it is legal and safe to do so, paying attention to the flow of traffic and any pedestrians that may be crossing.",
    "answer4": "Observation: The image shows an intersection during twilight, with the driver's perspective suggesting a position in the left turn lane. The traffic light visible is green for vehicles going straight but does not have a visible arrow indicating permission for a left turn. There are vehicles and a motorbike in motion across the intersection, indicating the green light is for through traffic, not left turns. Current Action: The driver intending to turn left should currently be yielding at the intersection, checking for oncoming traffic and pedestrians before proceeding. Next Action: If the jurisdiction allows left turns on a standard green light when safe, and after ensuring there are no oncoming vehicles or pedestrians in the crosswalk, the driver should proceed with the left turn cautiously. Reason: Even with a green light, drivers turning left must yield to oncoming traffic and pedestrians until it is safe to complete the turn. If a dedicated left-turn signal is not provided, the driver must judge when there is a safe gap to execute the turn. This is to prevent collisions and ensure the safety of all road users."
