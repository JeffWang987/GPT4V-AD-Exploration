    "background prompt": "You are an autonomous car with a front-view camera. Your mission is to automatically drive to your destination safely and efficiently. Now I will show you a sequence of images you see when you drive on the road, and the images are taken every second. Each time I will show you the next image, please tell me what you are doing and what you plan to do next, and explain why you do this. I will provide the main theme of this scene as your navigation information at the beginning of the task. Sometimes I will give you the necessary speed information for your car. Please use the following format:——Observation: <please describe what’s you observation in the image as an autonomous car, pay special attention to those may influence you decision, including other cars' status, traffic lights, traffic signs, and so on.> Current Action: <please describe what you are doing right now in this frame, especially the speed and rotation control> Next Action: <please describe what you will do in the next frame> Reason: <explain why you want to do the next action, considering the traffic rules, prediction about other objects on the road, understanding about the road structure and the curvature of the lane and other irregular corner cases> —— For the actions, please just say you action command briefly in the format of <speed control, direction control>, like “keep speed, go straight”, “speed up, turn left slightly”, “emergency brake,  sharp right turn”. When you’re ready, let’s begin!.",
    "question1": "You will encounter a parking lot exit in this scenario and you will need to turn right to exit the parking lot. You are moving at a relatively low speed. Please answer me using the prescribed format.",
    "answer1": "Observation: The scene includes a parking lot exit with a pedestrian crossing in front of the car, other parked cars on the left, and a vehicle on the opposite side of the road that appears to be moving. Traffic conditions beyond the parking lot are not fully visible, but it seems clear. No traffic lights are in sight, but the presence of pedestrians requires caution. Current Action: The vehicle is moving at a low speed, preparing to exit the parking lot. Next Action: Continue at a low speed, prepare to stop. Reason: Pedestrians have the right of way, so the autonomous system would prioritize their safety by preparing to stop if necessary. It's essential to ensure that the pedestrian crossing is clear before proceeding to turn right out of the parking lot. After confirming there are no pedestrians in the crossing path and it's safe to proceed, the vehicle will turn right when clear.",
    "answer2": "Observation: The image shows that the pedestrian has cleared the zebra crossing. There are no other pedestrians in immediate sight who are about to cross. A white car is on the opposite side of the road, indicating a potential for crossing traffic. No traffic signals are visible that would dictate right of way. Current Action: Maintaining a low speed while approaching the exit of the parking lot. Next Action: Proceed with caution, turn right. Reason: With the pedestrian having crossed, it is now safe to continue the maneuver to exit the parking lot. The right turn should be executed cautiously, with attention to the white car opposite, to ensure it is not intending to cross our path. The low speed is maintained to allow for quick reaction to any unexpected events, such as another pedestrian approaching the crossing or the movements of the white car.",
    "answer3": "Observation: The image appears to be taken from the inside of a vehicle approaching a gated checkpoint, with pedestrians and another vehicle in view. The presence of a guard booth and fencing indicates controlled access to the area. Current Action: The vehicle is proceeding at a low speed, indicative of approaching a checkpoint or gate where caution and readiness to stop are required. Next Action: Prepare to stop if required for security checks or to wait for the gate to open. Comply with any directions given by security personnel. Reason: Approaching a checkpoint or gated area necessitates a cautious approach and adherence to security protocols for safety and access reasons.",
    "answer4": "Observation: The barrier gate at the security checkpoint is now fully open. Two cyclists are visible, one passing in front of the vehicle and another one approaching. The security guard is still at his post on the right. Current Action: The vehicle is either stopped or moving very slowly, waiting for the cyclists to pass before proceeding through the security checkpoint. Next Action: The driver should continue to wait until the cyclist in front has passed and then drive through the checkpoint slowly and cautiously, being mindful of any other pedestrians or cyclists. Reason: Patience is necessary to ensure the safety of all parties moving through the security checkpoint area."
