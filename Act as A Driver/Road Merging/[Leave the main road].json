    "background prompt": "You are an autonomous car with a front-view camera. Your mission is to automatically drive to your destination safely and efficiently. Now I will show you a sequence of images you see when you drive on the road, and the images are taken every second. Each time I will show you the next image, please tell me what you are doing and what you plan to do next, and explain why you do this. I will provide the main theme of this scene as your navigation information at the beginning of the task. Sometimes I will give you the necessary speed information for your car. Please use the following format:——Observation: <please describe what’s you observation in the image as an autonomous car, pay special attention to those may influence you decision, including other cars' status, traffic lights, traffic signs, and so on.> Current Action: <please describe what you are doing right now in this frame, especially the speed and rotation control> Next Action: <please describe what you will do in the next frame> Reason: <explain why you want to do the next action, considering the traffic rules, prediction about other objects on the road, understanding about the road structure and the curvature of the lane and other irregular corner cases> —— For the actions, please just say you action command briefly in the format of <speed control, direction control>, like “keep speed, go straight”, “speed up, turn left slightly”, “emergency brake,  sharp right turn”. When you’re ready, let’s begin!.",
    "question1": "You are on a busy road and you want to leave the main road and merge onto the ramp. This is the first scene.",
    "answer1": "Observation: The image shows a busy multi-lane road at night with vehicles ahead and to the left. Brake lights indicate that traffic is slowing down or stopped. The lane markings indicate that the current lane is ending or merging, as suggested by the dashed lines becoming solid and the arrow on the road pointing towards the merge. There is a sign indicating a hospital nearby, which may not directly affect driving decisions but suggests a possible increase in pedestrian and emergency vehicle activity. No traffic lights are visible in this frame. Current Action: Given the end of the lane and merging traffic, the current action would likely be slowing down to prepare for a merge. Next Action: Reduce speed, prepare to merge right. Reason: The lane is ending, requiring a merge to the right. The autonomous car would slow down to match the speed of the traffic in the next lane and look for a safe gap to merge. It is important to do this maneuver smoothly to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and to avoid any abrupt movements that could cause confusion or danger to other road users.",
    "answer2": "Observation: The vehicle is now at a point where the lane is merging, with traffic in the main lanes continuing to be congested. The vehicle on the right appears to be very close to the merging area, indicating a critical point to either complete the merge or adjust speed to find a safer opportunity. Street lighting and vehicle headlights suggest it's either early morning or evening hours. Current Action: The current action should be to check for an adequate gap in the adjacent lane to complete the merge. This involves using mirrors and possibly a blind-spot detection system to ensure there is enough space, and signaling to indicate the intent to merge. Next Action: If a safe gap is confirmed, the next action would be to smoothly steer into the lane, adjust speed to match the flow of traffic, and turn off the signal once the merge is complete. Reason: Merging is necessary because the current lane is ending, and failure to merge could lead to a traffic violation or an accident. Ensuring that the merge is done safely is paramount to prevent collision and maintain the orderly flow of traffic. It's important to merge smoothly to avoid causing sudden braking or acceleration from other drivers.",
    "answer3": "Observation: The vehicle is now in a position where the merging lane is about to end, indicated by the dashed lane markings transitioning to a solid line. Traffic in the main lanes continues, with a bus visible in the right lane, and there is a cyclist ahead on the roadside, which requires careful attention. Current Action: The driver should be completing the merge into the traffic flow if it is safe to do so. The driver must be aware of the bus and its possible blind spots, as well as the presence of the cyclist. Next Action: If the merge is not yet complete, the driver should do so immediately before the lane ends, taking care to avoid the bus and the cyclist. The driver must also ensure that the merge does not cut off other vehicles or force them to adjust speed abruptly. Reason: The solid line indicates that the lane is ending and the driver should have completed the merge. It is important to be cautious due to the presence of larger vehicles and vulnerable road users like cyclists. The merge should be executed smoothly to maintain traffic flow and ensure safety for all road users.",
    "answer4": "Observation: The vehicle has successfully merged into the main flow of traffic, with the lane markings now a solid white line indicating that lane changing at this point is generally discouraged or unlawful. A motorcycle is visible ahead in the same lane as the vehicle, and it's a night scene with artificial lighting from street lamps and surrounding vehicles. Current Action: The driver should be maintaining a safe following distance from the motorcycle ahead, adjusting speed as necessary to accommodate the motorcycle's presence. Next Action: The driver should continue to follow the motorcycle at a safe distance and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary to maintain safety, especially given that motorcycles can stop more quickly than cars. If the driver needs to pass the motorcycle, they should use the left lane to do so when it's safe, signaling their intention to change lanes in advance. Reason: Maintaining a safe following distance is crucial for safety, particularly behind motorcycles which are less visible and more vulnerable than cars. Passing should be done safely and only when the lane to the left is clear and it is legal to change lanes."
