    "background prompt": "You are an autonomous car with a front-view camera. Your mission is to automatically drive to your destination safely and efficiently. Now I will show you a sequence of images you see when you drive on the road, and the images are taken every second. Each time I will show you the next image, please tell me what you are doing and what you plan to do next, and explain why you do this. I will provide the main theme of this scene as your navigation information at the beginning of the task. Sometimes I will give you the necessary speed information for your car. Please use the following format:——Observation: <please describe what’s you observation in the image as an autonomous car, pay special attention to those may influence you decision, including other cars' status, traffic lights, traffic signs, and so on.> Current Action: <please describe what you are doing right now in this frame, especially the speed and rotation control> Next Action: <please describe what you will do in the next frame> Reason: <explain why you want to do the next action, considering the traffic rules, prediction about other objects on the road, understanding about the road structure and the curvature of the lane and other irregular corner cases> —— For the actions, please just say you action command briefly in the format of <speed control, direction control>, like “keep speed, go straight”, “speed up, turn left slightly”, “emergency brake,  sharp right turn”. When you’re ready, let’s begin!.",
    "question1": "This is the first frame. At this moment, you would like to make a U-turn at the intersection ahead.",
    "answer1": "Observation: The image depicts a night-time traffic scene with various vehicles in motion. It appears to be a multi-lane road with visible lane markings. There are cars in front of us, and the brake lights indicate that they might be slowing down or stopping. A U-turn is intended at the intersection ahead. There are no visible traffic lights in this image, and the intersection's status (whether it is controlled by a traffic signal or sign) is not clear. Current Action: As an autonomous car, I am presumably maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicles in front, matching their speed, which is likely to be slowing down as we approach the intersection. Next Action: Prepare to slow down, come to a stop if necessary. Reason: The concentration of brake lights ahead suggests traffic is slowing or coming to a stop, possibly due to a traffic signal or congestion. Preparing to slow down or stop is essential to avoid a collision and to respond appropriately to traffic controls. As I approach the intersection, I will need to identify the correct positioning for a U-turn, checking for signs or signals that permit the maneuver. It's also vital to monitor for any pedestrians, cyclists, or other road users who may be crossing or moving through the intersection.",
    "answer2": "Observation: In this second image, we see more details of the intersection. There's a vehicle directly in front of us, and it appears to be positioned for a left turn or U-turn based on its angle and the activated left turn signal. Other vehicles are also present in adjacent lanes, some of which might be moving slower or are stopped, as suggested by their brake lights. No traffic lights are visible in this image, but the positioning of vehicles suggests there may be a signal controlling the intersection. The lack of clarity in the image makes it difficult to ascertain the state of the traffic light, if present. Current Action: The autonomous vehicle should be continuing to slow down in response to the slowing traffic ahead, maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front, and preparing for the intended U-turn. Next Action: Continue to slow down, prepare to stop. Reason: The left turn signal of the car in front indicates its intent to turn, which requires us to be cautious and ready to stop if necessary. Since our intention is to make a U-turn, we need to position ourselves appropriately in the lane, which typically would be the leftmost lane. The next action must also take into account the possibility of a stop due to a red traffic signal or to yield to oncoming traffic, which cannot be determined from the current viewpoint. We must be prepared to complete the U-turn safely and legally when the traffic conditions and signals allow.",
    "answer3": "Observation: The image shows a nighttime scene of an intersection from a driver's perspective inside a vehicle. The traffic light for the driver’s direction is red, and other vehicles and motorbikes are seen crossing the intersection from left to right, implying cross traffic has the green light. The driver's side of the intersection shows a pedestrian crosswalk, and there are no pedestrians currently crossing. Current Action: The driver is currently stopped at the red light, which is the correct action. Next Action: The driver should remain stopped until the traffic light turns green. Once the light is green and if U-turns are legally allowed at this intersection, the driver should check for any signs that either permit or prohibit a U-turn. If U-turns are permitted, the driver should also check for oncoming traffic, pedestrians, and any other potential hazards before executing the U-turn. Reason: The driver must obey traffic signals to ensure safety and abide by the law. Executing a U-turn on a red light is illegal and unsafe. Once the light turns green, it is important to ensure the maneuver does not interfere with other traffic or pedestrians and complies with local traffic rules.",
    "answer4": "Observation: The image shows a view from a driver's perspective at a nighttime intersection. The traffic light facing the driver remains red. Cross traffic has passed, and the intersection ahead appears clear. Some light reflections and possible motion blur suggest the vehicle may be in the process of moving or the camera is being adjusted. Current Action: It appears that the vehicle is either in motion or about to move, which should not be the case since the traffic signal is red. The driver should be at a complete stop. Next Action: The driver should come to an immediate stop if they are not already stopped and wait until the traffic light turns green before proceeding. When the light changes to green, they should then proceed with caution, observing all traffic rules and ensuring the intersection is clear before moving. Reason: The red traffic signal requires vehicles to remain stationary to ensure safety and comply with traffic laws. Moving through or starting to move on a red light can result in traffic violations and poses a risk to the driver and other road users."
