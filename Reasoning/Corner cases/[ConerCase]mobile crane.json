  "question": "You're the mature driver behind the wheel and this image is what you see now.  Describe what you see and what you plan to drive next. You don't have to break it down into points. You can just make it into a paragraph.",
  "answer": "From behind the wheel, I see a large construction truck in the lane ahead of me. It's a prominent orange and yellow vehicle with noticeable safety markings, and it seems to be carrying construction equipment. Further ahead, there's a crossroads with traffic lights, and several vehicles are either stopped or in motion. On my right, there's a crane in the distance, indicating ongoing construction work in the area. In addition to cars, there are scooters and cyclists crossing the junction, suggesting that the area is bustling with mixed vehicular and pedestrian traffic. With safety in mind, I plan to maintain a safe distance from the large construction vehicle and remain alert to the various road users around me. As the traffic light seems to be in favor of our direction, I'll smoothly accelerate once the truck ahead moves, ensuring I watch for any pedestrians or smaller vehicles that might dart out unexpectedly."
