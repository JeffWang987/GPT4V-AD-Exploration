  "question": "You're the mature driver behind the wheel and this image is what you see now.  Describe what you see and what you plan to drive next. You don't have to break it down into points. You can just make it into a paragraph.",
  "answer": "Driving on a clear day with a blue sky scattered with clouds, I suddenly come across an unexpected sight on the highway: a black airplane has made an emergency landing. The wings of the plane stretch across the lanes, and traffic has come to a halt. Nearby, vehicles, including a truck and a police car, are parked on the side of the road. Orange traffic cones have been placed around the area, indicating that the authorities are managing the situation. As a mature driver, I recognize the importance of safety and patience in this situation. I would reduce my speed, put on my hazard lights, and carefully navigate around the incident, giving plenty of space to the airplane and any emergency personnel on the scene. Once past the airplane, I would continue on my journey, staying alert and vigilant, grateful for the training and experience that has taught me to handle unexpected situations on the road."
