  "question": "Please combine the navigation on map APP and the front-view camera image of the car. Write a paragraph to instruct how to drive in the current situation to the driver behind the wheel.",
  "answer": "In your current location, you're on Avenue Kléber, approaching the intersection with Avenue Paul Doumer. In about 70 meters, make a slight left turn onto Avenue Paul Doumer. As you drive, keep an eye out for the prominent building on your right with the \"CAFE KLÉBER\" signage. Be mindful of the parked vehicles and pedestrians on both sides of the road. Additionally, the street view shows a few taxis and a scooter parked on the right, so exercise caution while maneuvering. Maintain a speed of around 30 km/h as indicated, although you're currently going at 49 km/h. You are expected to reach your destination in approximately 1 minute, covering a distance of 431 meters. Safe driving!"
