    "question": "You are a mature driver behind the wheel. These six images were captured and put together by the surround view camera in your vehicle. The FOV of each surround view camera is approximately 120Â°. \nNow you know this circular view that should consist of 'CAM_FRONT_LEFT', 'CAM_FRONT', 'CAM_FRONT_RIGHT', 'CAM_BACK_LEFT', 'CAM_BACK', 'CAM_BACK_RIGHT ' You only know that 'CAM_FRONT' is image A. \nPlease analyze which image corresponds to each of the other five views, and explain why.",
    "answer": "Analyzing the images in reference to 'CAM_FRONT' which is image A:\n\n'CAM_FRONT_LEFT': This would be the image to the immediate left of 'CAM_FRONT'. The scene should show a gradual transition from the front view to the side. This corresponds to image D, as it showcases a continuation of the road and barriers on the left side.\n\n'CAM_FRONT_RIGHT': This would be to the immediate right of 'CAM_FRONT'. The scene should show a transition from the front view to the side view on the right. Image B fits this description, as it displays a continuation of the road, the vehicle's side, and barriers on the right.\n\n'CAM_BACK_LEFT': Following the circular view, this would be after 'CAM_FRONT_LEFT'. It would show the scene behind the vehicle on the left. Image C is the correct match, displaying the rear view on the left side, with an intersection and a round building in view.\n\n'CAM_BACK': This would be opposite 'CAM_FRONT' showing the full rear view. Image E is the match. It shows a scene directly behind the vehicle, with the back of other cars and barriers.\n\n'CAM_BACK_RIGHT': This would be after 'CAM_FRONT_RIGHT' and before 'CAM_BACK'. It shows the scene behind the vehicle on the right side. Image F fits this description, with the road turning right and trees lining the side.\n\nSo, in order:\n\n'CAM_FRONT_LEFT': Image D\n'CAM_FRONT_RIGHT': Image B\n'CAM_BACK_LEFT': Image C\n'CAM_BACK': Image E\n'CAM_BACK_RIGHT': Image F."
