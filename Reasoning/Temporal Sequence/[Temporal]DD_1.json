  "question": "This is a time series of four pictures taken from a driving recorder. The chronological order is marked on the corresponding subfigure. As the driver of the car, please describe what happened in these four seconds, what actions you performed, and why you performed the actions you did.",
  "answer": "In the four-second time series:\nAt 0 seconds, I was driving on a straight road with a car in front of me and saw a scooter rider approaching the divider.\nBy 1 second, I noticed the scooter rider making a move to cross the road, so I started to slow down and steer slightly to the left to create space and avoid any potential hazard.\nAt 2 seconds, the scooter rider was now crossing my lane, and I continued to maintain a safe distance from the car in front and the scooter.\nBy 3 seconds, the scooter rider had crossed to the other side, and I realigned my car to the center of the lane.\nI slowed down and steered to avoid a potential collision with the scooter rider, ensuring both our safety and the safety of other road users."
