As the driver of the car, please describe in detail what happened in these four seconds, what actions you performed, and why you performed the actions you did.",
  "answer": "I approached an intersection with a green traffic light ahead.  As I neared the crosswalk, I noticed pedestrians beginning to cross the street. I maintained my position, ensuring not to obstruct the crosswalk, and waited for the pedestrians to clear. The light turned yellow, then red, indicating for me to remain stopped. I obeyed the traffic signals and waited for the appropriate time to proceed."
