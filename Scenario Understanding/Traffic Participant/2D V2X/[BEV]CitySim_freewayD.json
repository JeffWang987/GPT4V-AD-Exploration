  "question": "This is a bird-eye view of a traffic scenario. Describe what you see, especially the traffic participants and road topology. No need for sub-points.",
  "answer": "The image provides a bird-eye view of a multilane highway. Multiple vehicles, including cars, trucks, and vans, are scattered across the lanes, moving in both directions. Some vehicles are merging onto or exiting the highway via on and off-ramps. The highway has a central barrier separating the lanes of opposing traffic. On one side of the highway, there's a railway track, while on the other side, a rocky coastline can be observed. Pedestrian pathways and greenery are visible alongside the road. Junctions and intersections are marked with road signs, traffic lights, and lane indicators, making navigation easier for the drivers. There are no evident traffic congestions or incidents, and traffic appears to be flowing smoothly."
