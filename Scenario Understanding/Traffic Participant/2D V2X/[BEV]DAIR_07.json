  "question": "This is a photo from bird-eye view of a traffic camera. Describe what you see, especially the traffic participants, road topology and traffic lights (if applicable). No need for sub-points.",
  "answer": "The image presents a bird-eye view of an urban intersection. Several cars, including a prominent yellow taxi, are at various positions on the road. Cyclists navigate the intersection, with bikes in colors like yellow and white. Pedestrians cross the streets using zebra crosswalks. The road design consists of multiple lanes, zebra crosswalks, and cyclist pathways marked by bicycle symbols. A center median with decorative lights splits the main traffic directions. Traffic lights, currently displaying red signals, are positioned around the intersection. Barriers and road dividers indicate possible roadwork or construction zones, and a blue structure is visible on one side."
