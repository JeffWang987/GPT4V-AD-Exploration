  "question": "This is a photo  from bird-eye view of a traffic camera. Describe what you see, especially the traffic participants, road topology and traffic lights (if applicable). \n Please answer in brief and no need for sub-points.",
  "answer": "The image captures a bird-eye view of an urban intersection. Cars are aligned, waiting for the green signal, with a lone motorbike, driven by a rider wearing a yellow helmet and carrying a rear box, crossing the intersection. A few pedestrians are on the sidewalks, some waiting to cross. The road design includes multiple lanes with zebra crosswalks, cyclist pathways marked by bicycle symbols, and various directional arrows. Traffic lights are visible around the intersection, with the majority showing a red signal. Barriers and road dividers are scattered throughout, indicating roadwork or designated pathways. There's a central median with trees and a blue-tarped area on one side of the road."
